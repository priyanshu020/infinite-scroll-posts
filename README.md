# Infinite Scroll Posts

This project is implemented with infinite scrolling on blog posts which is initially fetching five posts and if you scroll down it will fetch five more posts and basically makes this an infinite scroll by fetching posts from an [API](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). 

There is also a filter posts input where you can filter the posts you already have by searched keywords.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is that when you hit a certain point in your scroll it will fetch the next batch of posts after a CSS loader.
